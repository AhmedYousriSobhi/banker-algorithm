# banker-algorithm
The bankerâ€™s algorithm and how it determines the presence or absence of the safe state

##Inputs :
A filename from the keyboard, read the file for the pertinent data.The file contains the
snapshot of a system at a certain time.The system has 5 processes and 3 resource
types.
The first 5 lines (each line representing a process) in the input file will contain the current
Allocation matrix for the system (with 3 resources).The second 5 lines in the input file will
be the maximum possible resource request for each of the 5 process.The final line will
contain the available resources at the time of the snapshot.
##Outputs:
A prompt for which file is to be read. Then the output will be if the current state is safe
and a possible execution sequence for the system.
